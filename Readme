A Paper Scissors Rock example.

This project provides a simple example of the Visitor design pattern.
A recent version of Cmake is recommended(VERSION 3.16 or higher).
Since std::numbers::pi is used (rather than M_PI), C++20 is recommended.

(I) Build the project:

	Windows:
	Method 1:
	(1) open command line, cd to the project folder (where CMakeLists.txt locates)
	(2) run command: cmake -S . -B build
	(3) run command: cmake --build build --clean-first
	Method 2:
	(1) double click the "win_build.bat" file under the project folder

	Linux: (if there is no privilege to open the .sh file, please apply chmod command to the .sh file, for example: chmod 777 filename)
	(1) open bash, cd to the project folder (where CMakeLists.txt locates)
	(2) run command: ./build.sh

(II) Run the project (after successfully built the project):

	Windows:
	Method 1:
	(1) open command line, cd to the project folder (where CMakeLists.txt locates)
	(2) run command: build\debug\IMC
	Method 2:
	(1) double click the "win_run.bat" file under the project folder

	Linux:
	(1) open bash, cd to the project folder (where CMakeLists.txt locates) -- if its already opened then no need to reopen it
	(2) run command: ./run.sh
